1-C. throws on line 5 and throw on line 6 - OK

2-F. The code already compiles as is. --WRONG

2. B, C. Option A is incorrect because it will move the compilation error to the close() method
since it does throw an exception that must be handled or declared. Option B is correct
because the unhandled exception becomes declared. Option C is correct because the exception
becomes handled. Option D is incorrect because the exception remains unhandled.



3-E. IOException | RuntimeException e - OK


4- OK
A. A traditional try statement without a catch block requires a finally block.
B. A traditional try statement without a finally block requires a catch block.


5-OK
TWDEF
C. TWDEF

5. C. After opening both resources in the try-with-resources statement, T is printed. Then the
try-with-resource completes and closes the resources in reverse order from which they were
opened. After W is printed, an exception is thrown. However, the remaining resource is still
closed and D is printed. The exception thrown is then caught and E is printed. Last, the
finally block is run, printing F. Therefore the answer is TWDEF.



6-OK
G. The code does not compile.

7-OK
C. The code throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

8-OK
B. java –ea On
C. java -da -ea:On On

9-OK
A. assert n < 0: "OhNo";
D. assert(n < 0): "OhNo";


10-
A. Line 5 does not compile.
E. Line 7 is an appropriate use of an assertion.


11-WRONG
B. IllegalStateException
D. MissingResourceException


java.text.ParseException --CHECKED EXCEPTION
java.time.DateTimeException--UNCHECKED EXCEPTION


11. B, D, E. You need to memorize the contents of Table 6.2 and Table 6.3 before the exam.



12-WRONG
A. // leave line blank
C. e = new RuntimeException(); --WRONG
D. e = new SneezeException();
E. e = new SniffleException();

12. A, D, E. Since a single exception type is caught, only the same type of exception or a subclass
is allowed to be assigned to the variable in the catch block. Therefore D and E are
correct. Additionally A is correct because there are no changes to the variable.



13-OK
A. // leave line blank

14-OK
F. None of the above; the code does not compile

15-OK
B. Two
E. Five

16-WRONG
F. snow 2

16. C. The exception inside the try block becomes the primary exception since it is
thrown first. Then two suppressed exceptions are added to it when trying to close the
AutoCloseable resources.



17-OK
A. AutoCloseable
B. Closeable

18-OK
B. Exception, Closeable

18. B. The main difference between AutoCloseable and Closeable is that AutoCloseable has
Exception in the signature and Closeable has only IOException in the signature. Since
IllegalStateException is a runtime exception, it can be thrown by any method.



19-WRONG
D. SQLException | IOException
B. RuntimeException--WRONG

19. D. Choice A is allowed because Java 7 and later “translates” Exception in a catch block to
the correct one. Choices C and E are allowed because they actually catch a SQLException.
Choice D is not allowed because there is no IOException declared. Choice B is allowed
because a method does not have to handle an exception if it declares it.



20-OK
E. None of the above.

20. E. You can create checked or unchecked exceptions. The default constructor is used if one is
not supplied. There is no requirement to implement specific methods.
