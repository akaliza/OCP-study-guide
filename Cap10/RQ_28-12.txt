1-WRONG
A. Driver
E. Statement

1. B, F. The Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces are part of the JDK,
making choices A and E incorrect. The concrete DriverManager class is also part of the
JDK, making choices C and D incorrect. Choices B and F are correct since the implementation
of these interfaces is part of the database-specific driver JAR file.



2-WRONG 2/3
C. jdbc
B. Database name
D. Location of database==WRONG


2. B, C. A JDBC URL has three parts. The first part is the string jdbc, making choice C correct.
The second part is the vendor/product name. The third part is database specific, but it
includes a database name, making choice B correct as well. The location, such as IP address
and port, is optional.



3-OK
A. jdbc:sybase:localhost:1234/db

A JDBC URL has three main parts separated by single colons, making choices B,


4-OK
E. META-INF/service/java.sql.Driver ****

5-OK
C. There is a compiler error on line 6.


6-OK
B. Class.forName() throws a ClassNotFoundException if the driver class is not
found.
E. DriverManager.getConnection() throws a SQLException if the driver class is not
found.


7-OK

public void stmt(Connection conn, int b) throws SQLException {
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement( , b);
}

C. ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
E. ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
F. ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE




8-OK
E. The code will run without throwing an exception.


9-OK
boolean bool = stmt._____________ (sql); execute
int num      = stmt._____________ (sql); executeUpdate
ResultSet rs = stmt._____________ (sql); executeQuery

B. execute, executeUpdate, executeQuery


10-OK
public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:zoo");
   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
   int result = stmt.executeUpdate("update animal set name = name");
   System.out.println(result); //5
}

C. 5

11-OK
public static void main(String[] args) {
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:zoo");
   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
   int result = stmt.executeUpdate("update food set amount = amount + 1");
   System.out.println(result);
}

D. The code does not compile.

12-WRONG
B. Connection, Statement, ResultSet

12. D. JDBC resources should be closed in the reverse order from that in which they were
opened. The order for opening is Connection, Statement, and ResultSet. The order for
closing is ResultSet, Statement, and Connection.



13-OK

try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:zoo");
     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select count(*) from species");
   int num = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO species VALUES (3, 'Ant', .05)");
   rs.next();
   System.out.println(rs.getInt(1));
}

D. A SQLException is thrown.

A Statement automatically closes the open ResultSet when another SQL statement is
run. This means that rs is no longer open by the println, and a SQLException is thrown
because the ResultSet is closed.


14-OK
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
if (rs.next()) {
___________________
}

B. String s = rs.getString(1);
F. Object s = rs.getObject(1);


15-OK
print the month, date, year, hour, minute, and second

F. rs.getTimeStamp("d");



16-OK

String sql = "select name from animal";
try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:zoo");
     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql)) {
   rs.next();
   rs.previous();
   rs.previous();
   rs.next();
   rs.next();
   rs.absolute(2);
   System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}


E. A SQLException is thrown.

By default, a Statement is not scrollable. The first call to previous() throws a SQLException
because the ResultSet type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY.

===========================
E. A SQLException is thrown.

17-WRONG


A. absolute()

17. C, D. Choices B and E are incorrect because those methods don’t exist. Choices A and F are
incorrect because these methods return a boolean. Choices C and D are correct.
C. afterLast()
D. beforeFirst()


18-WRONG ---- 
D. The code does not compile.

18. A. The call to absolute(0) moves the cursor to a location immediately before the results,
and then next() goes to the first row, so the answer is choice A.

absolute PODE SER CHAMADO POR DEFAULT**** NAO - ACHO QUE ESTA ERRADO


19-OK

C. Three

19. C. The first println outputs false because the cursor is immediately before the result.
The second println outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the fifth row. The third
println outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the fourth row. The fourth println
outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the second row. The fifth println outputs
false because the cursor is located before the beginning of the result.


20-WRONG
C. Three

20. F. The first and last println statements do not compile. The beforeFirst() and
afterLast() methods have a void return type. Therefore, the code does not compile and
choice F is correct.
