C. A driver manager ensures the atomic properties of a transaction.
The other three options A, B, and D are true. A driver manager maintains a list of
available data sources and their drivers. Given a database URL, the driver manager
chooses an appropriate driver to communicate with the respective DBMS. Further, a
driver manager manages multiple concurrent drivers connected to their respective
data sources. However, it is not responsible for maintaining atomicity properties
when performing transactions.

3. A. This program will print the following: SQLException.
The statement while (resultSet.next()) is missing.


4 - errado.

The correct options are C and E.
You can get an instance of PreparedStatement by calling the
preparedStatement() method in the Connection interface. The Statement
interface and its derived interfaces implement the AutoCloseable interface, so
Statement objects can be used with the try-with-resources statement.
The other three options A, B, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:
A: Statement objects can be used for SQL queries that have no parameters. Only a
CallableStatement can handle IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters.
B: PreparedStatement is used for precompiled SQL statements. The
CallableStatement type is used for stored procedures.
D: CallableStatement implements the PreparedStatement interface.
PreparedStatement in turn implements the Statement interface. Further, these
three types are interfaces, not classes.


5 - OK 

B. Statement statement = connection.createStatement();

C. Replacing Stmt #1 with resultSet.moveToInsertRow(); and Stmt #2 with
resultSet.insertRow(); will make the program work.
You need to call the moveToInsertRow() method in order to insert a new row: this
method prepares the resultset for creating a new row. Once the row is updated, you
need to call insertRow() to insert the row into the resultset and the database.

7. - OK 
A. Calling absolute(1) on a ResultSet instance is equivalent to calling
first(), and calling absolute(-1) is equivalent to calling last().



8. - errado

C. This program crashes by throwing a SQLException.
The try-with-resources block is closed before the while statement executes.
Calling resultSet.next() results in making a call on the closed ResultSet object.
Hence, this program results in throwing a SQLException (“Operation not allowed
after ResultSet closed”).
