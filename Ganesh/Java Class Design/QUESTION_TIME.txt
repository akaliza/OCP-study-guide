class Base {}
class DeriOne extends Base {}
class DeriTwo extends Base {}
class ArrayStore {
public static void main(String []args) {
   Base [] baseArr = new DeriOne[3];
   baseArr[0] = new DeriOne();  
   baseArr[2] = new DeriTwo(); ---->>> ERRO
   System.out.println(baseArr.length);
}
}


3. C. This program throws an ArrayStoreException
The variable baseArr is of type Base[], and it points to an array of type DeriOne.
However, in the statement baseArr[2] = new DeriTwo(), an object of type DeriTwo
is assigned to the type DeriOne, which does not share a parent-child inheritance
relationship-they only have a common parent, which is Base. Hence, this assignment
results in an ArrayStoreException.


5. A. Compiler error: ‘{’ expected – cannot extend two classes
Java does not support multiple class inheritance. Since ColoredRectangle
and RoundedRectangle are classes, it results in a compiler error when
ColoredRoundedRectangle class attempts to extend these two classes. Note that it is
acceptable for a class to be empty.
