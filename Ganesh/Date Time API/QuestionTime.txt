LocalDate babyDOB = LocalDate.of(2015, Month.FEBRUARY, 20);
LocalDate now = LocalDate.of(2016, Month.APRIL, 10);
System.out.println(Period.between(now, babyDOB).getYears()); // PERIOD_CALC

D. T he code segment prints: -1
Here are the arguments to the between() method in the Period class:
Period between(LocalDate startDateInclusive, LocalDate
endDateExclusive)
The first argument is the start and the second argument is the end, and hence the
call Period.between(now, babyDOB) results in -1 (not +1).
