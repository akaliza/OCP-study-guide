6- OK
b) R emoving only Stmt-1 will make the program compilable and it will print the
following: Base: Hello Derived

c) R emoving only Stmt-2 will make the program compilable and it will print the
following: Base Derived

d) R emoving both Stmt-1 and Stmt-2 will make the program compilable and it
will print the following: Base Derived


7- ERRADO 
d) T he program will compile without any error


Statement #1 will result in a compiler error since the keyword protected is not
allowed inside a method body. You cannot provide access specifiers (public,
protected, or private) inside a method body.


8- OK 
c) int years = Period.between(joiningDate, now).getYears();

9- OK 
class Outer {
  class Inner {  
    public void print() {
 	System.out.println("Inner: print");
    }
  }
}
class Test {
   public static void main(String []args) {
   // Stmt#1
   inner.print();
   }
}


d) Outer.Inner inner = new Outer().new Inner();

10- OK
c) When executed, this program prints 10

yes, instance of Enum


12- ok
a) An enum can have private constructor
c) An enum can have public methods and fields
d) An enum can implement an interface
